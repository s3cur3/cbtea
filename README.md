# CBTea 🍵

**A privacy-first cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app.**

CBTea provides an interface for a common exercise in CBT: the automatic, negative thought record. It's a way to help you identify and challenge negative thoughts, with the ultimate goal of changing your thinking patterns and helping you feel better.

This codebase is an Elixir re-implementation of the GPL v3 [Quirk][1] React Native app. There's a demo of it in action [on the Wayback Machine][2].
